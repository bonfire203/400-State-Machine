## Project Description

This project was assigned to Dr. Daniel Hampikian's GIMM 400 course. We were instructed in making a VR game that implements and demonstrates learning of a state machine. \

I will ask you and your group to create a minigame that implements a state machine in unity that you can interact with in VR and that changes itâ€™s state based on that VR interaction.  The parameters of the game are that it has at least 3 state machine implemented behaviors at different times/conditions and a core game loop that is intuitive to play and fun to play.  The assets do not all have to be your own but your artist must make audio/visual contributions as well as handle imports of third party assets.  Within those parameters you are free to create any kind of minigame you wish, just keep in mind that there is only about a month of development time for each minigame so curtail your ambitions accordingly.
